The XM5 exposes an [Android Head Tracker HID sensor](https://source.android.com/docs/core/interaction/sensors/head-tracker-hid-protocol)
over Bluetooth. This program discovers that sensor, enables reporting, parses
the headset's orientation, and streams it out over UDP — as
[OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) doubles **and** a JSON
datagram — so you can drive spatial audio, sim/game head-look, or anything else
that wants to know where your head is pointing. It also ships a flicker-free
diagnostics GUI with a live yaw/pitch/roll graph and a one-click **Repair
Tracker** button for the times Windows refuses to enumerate the sensor.

Everything is in one file: [`xm5_head_tracker.cpp`](xm5_head_tracker.cpp).

> **Hardware status:** changing orientation reports have been received and parsed

## Where the data goes (ports)

In `bridge` mode (and while the GUI is open) head-tracking data is streamed over
**UDP to loopback (`127.0.0.1`)** on two adjacent ports:

| Port            | Format                          | Consumer                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **`4242`** (`--port`) | Six little-endian `double`s `(x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll)` | OpenTrack "UDP over network" |
| **`4243`** (`--port` + 1) | UTF-8 JSON object (see below)   | Your own apps / scripts           |

Change the base port with `--port N`; the JSON port is always `N + 1`. The
bridge prints both destinations on startup, and the GUI shows them along the
bottom edge. Translation axes `(x, y, z)` are always zero — this protocol
reports orientation only.

The JSON datagram (one per sample, `version: 2`):

```jsonc
{
  "version": 2,
  "rotationVector":  [x, y, z],            // axis-angle, radians
  "quaternion":      [w, x, y, z],         // recentered orientation
  "yprDegrees":      [yaw, pitch, roll],   // degrees
  "gyroscope":       [x, y, z],            // rad/s, or null if unavailable
  "accelerometer":   [x, y, z],            // m/s^2, or null if the device doesn't report it
  "angularVelocity": [x, y, z],            // deprecated alias of "gyroscope"
  "resetCounter":    0,
  "packetsPerSecond": 25.0,
  "receiveLatencyMs": -1.0                 // -1 when the device provides no timestamp
}
```

> **Security:** UDP output is loopback-only by default and has **no
> authentication**. Do not bind or forward it to an untrusted network.

A full wire-format reference lives in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Gyroscope and accelerometer

Both inertial streams are exposed in full, in addition to orientation:

- **Gyroscope** — angular velocity in **rad/s**, emitted as the JSON
  `gyroscope` array (and shown live in the GUI). This is the WH-1000XM5's
  on-board gyro as carried by the Android Head Tracker protocol.
- **Accelerometer** — linear acceleration in **m/s²**, emitted as the JSON
  `accelerometer` array **when the device reports it**.

  The Android Head Tracker HID profile that the XM5 advertises defines only
  orientation + gyro fields, so on current Sony firmware `accelerometer` is
  typically `null`. The bridge nonetheless parses the standard HID sensor-page
  acceleration usages (`0x0453`–`0x0455`, plus the vector form `0x0452`) from
  every input report, so if your firmware exposes them they are surfaced
  automatically — no code change needed. Gyro is likewise parsed from both the
  head-tracker custom field (`0x0545`) and the standard sensor-page usages.

## Default orientation: YXZ, X and Z inverted

The default axis convention is **YXZ order with the X and Z axes inverted** — the
mapping that produces correct head tracking on the WH-1000XM5. It is fully
overridable:

- **CLI:** `--axis-map XYZ` (any permutation) and `--invert X` (any axes). The
  `--invert` flag is a complete override — `--invert xz` reproduces the default,
  `--invert z` inverts Z only, and `--invert none` clears all inversions.
- **GUI:** the axis-order dropdown (defaults to YXZ) and the Invert X/Y/Z
  checkboxes (Invert X and Z start checked).

The same axis convention is applied to the gyroscope and accelerometer vectors
so all streams share one coordinate frame.

## Build

Requires a C++20-capable MSVC and a current Windows 11 SDK
(install **Desktop development with C++** in the Visual Studio Installer).

```bat
build.cmd
```

`build.cmd` locates the Visual Studio C++ tools automatically. Or build by hand
from a *x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS*:

```bat
cl /std:c++latest /EHsc /permissive- /utf-8 /O2 /W3 /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE xm5_head_tracker.cpp /Fe:xm5-headtracker.exe
```

All required import libraries are pulled in via `#pragma comment(lib, ...)`, so
no extra linker arguments are needed. Every push is built in CI on
`windows-latest` — see [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml).

## Pair the headphones

1. Update the XM5 with Sony's app and enable its spatial-audio / head-tracking
   feature if available, then put the headset in pairing mode.
2. In Windows 11: **Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Add device → Bluetooth**,
   pair **WH-1000XM5**.
3. Run `xm5-headtracker.exe probe`. A usable collection shows usage
   `0x0020:0x00E1` and a feature description beginning with `#AndroidHeadTracker#`.

## Usage

```text
xm5-headtracker.exe                 (no args -> diagnostics GUI)
xm5-headtracker.exe probe [--include-disabled]
xm5-headtracker.exe dump [--seconds N]
xm5-headtracker.exe repair
xm5-headtracker.exe bluetooth-probe [--all-le] [--name "WH-1000XM5"]
xm5-headtracker.exe bluetooth-rebind [--name "WH-1000XM5"]
xm5-headtracker.exe bluetooth-generic-hid        (run from an elevated prompt)
xm5-headtracker.exe bridge [--port 4242] [--seconds N]
                           [--axis-map YXZ] [--invert XZ] [--smoothing 0.18]
```

- **`bridge`** is the main mode. It reconnects automatically and streams to the
  ports described in [Where the data goes](#where-the-data-goes-ports).
- **`probe`** prints discovered HID collections and Sensor API custom sensors.
- **`dump`** prints untouched HID input reports (`--seconds N` for a bounded run).
- **`repair`** is the one-click recovery (see below).

## The GUI

Launch with no arguments. You get a device list with full descriptor detail, a
flicker-free live yaw/pitch/roll graph (double-buffered, with a degree grid and
legend), live gyroscope/accelerometer readouts, the active UDP ports along the
bottom, and:

- **Refresh** — re-enumerate devices and reconnect.
- **Repair Tracker** — one-click recovery when Windows won't enumerate the
  sensor (asks for a single administrator prompt).
- **Recenter** — set the current pose as forward (global hotkey **Ctrl+Alt+C**).
- **Axis order / Invert X·Y·Z / Smoothing** — live tuning, defaulting to
  YXZ + invert-X-and-Z.

The GUI also streams to UDP `4242` (+JSON on `4243`) while open.

## OpenTrack

Choose **UDP over network** as the input, set its port to `4242`, start
`xm5-headtracker.exe bridge --port 4242`, then press **Start** in OpenTrack. The
application uses yaw/pitch/roll in degrees.

## When the sensor won't show up

Windows sometimes pairs the XM5 but never creates the head-tracker HID node, or
parks it with Device Manager **Code 10**. The bridge has read-only diagnostics
and a targeted, driver-only recovery (it never installs a custom kernel driver):

1. **Repair Tracker** in the GUI, or `xm5-headtracker.exe repair`. This closes
   stale instances, re-enables only the XM5's standard HID service, binds the
   failed node to Microsoft's inbox generic HID driver, verifies the
   `#AndroidHeadTracker#` marker, and reopens.
2. If `bluetooth-probe` finds the Android descriptor but `probe` doesn't, run
   `bluetooth-rebind`, wait for reconnection, and probe again.
3. If Device Manager shows the **HID Custom Sensor** with Code 10, open an
   **elevated** prompt and run `bluetooth-generic-hid` once.

Other tips:

- Close Sony utilities, spatial-audio tools, and anything else that may hold the
  device with exclusive access, then **Refresh**.
- If reports stay still, confirm Full Power, All Events, and a nonzero supported
  interval were accepted in the log. The tested XM5 advertises 40 ms and produces
  about 25 packets/second.

## Protocol & security notes

The implementation follows the official Android Head Tracker HID protocol: it
accepts compatible version strings, reads report IDs and lengths from
`HIDP_CAPS`, accesses fields through `HidP_*`, and honours each value
capability's logical/physical ranges and HID unit exponent.

UDP output is loopback-only by default and has **no authentication** — do not
bind or forward it to an untrusted network.
